# HW-3 | Graphs and Trees

## Welcome ðŸŒž

The homework consists of two independent tasks. You will practice applying the maximum flow algorithm to model logistics networks, analyzing optimal routes for product flows, and identifying network constraints. Additionally, you will compare the performance of OOBTree and dict data structures for range queries, determining the efficiency of each in storing and accessing large amounts of data.

Ready? Let's get to work!

Good luck! ðŸ˜Ž

| From        | To         | Capacity (units) |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| Terminal 1 | Warehouse 1 | 25               |
| Terminal 1 | Warehouse 2 | 20               |

| Terminal 2 | Warehouse 3 | 15               |
| Terminal 2 | Warehouse 4 | 30               |
| Terminal 2 | Warehouse 2 | 10               |
| Warehouse 1 | Store 1   | 15               |
| Warehouse 1 | Store 2   | 10               |
| Warehouse 1 | Store 3   | 20               |
| Warehouse 2 | Store 4   | 15               |
| Warehouse 2 | Store 5   | 10               |
| Warehouse 2 | Store 6   | 25               |
| Warehouse 3 | Store 7   | 20               |
| Warehouse 3 | Store 8   | 15               |
| Warehouse 3 | Store 9   | 10               |
| Warehouse 4 | Store 10  | 20               |
| Warehouse 4 | Store 11  | 10               |
| Warehouse 4 | Store 12  | 15               |

Apply the maximum flow algorithm to solve the problem. Write a program implementing
the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, or use an existing implementation to determine the 
maximum flow in the constructed graph. Analyze the obtained results. Has the 
optimal flow been achieved, and what does this mean for the considered network?

Prepare a report with calculations and explanations. Describe which vertices 
and edges were chosen and how they correspond to real elements of the logistics 
system. Show a step-by-step calculation of the maximum flow and explain the 
logic behind each step.

### Technical Requirements

1. Use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to implement maximum flow.
2. The graph structure must match the given network with 20 vertices and specified capacities.

### Acceptance Criteria

ðŸ“Œ The acceptance criteria for the homework are mandatory for review by the mentor. If any criteria are not met, the mentor will return the homework for revision without evaluation. If you need "just a clarification" ðŸ˜‰ or get "stuck" at any stage, contact the mentor in Slack.

1. The program correctly calculates the maximum flow and returns accurate results.
2. Data is correctly added to the graph and matches the given logistics network structure.
3. Explanations and analysis are clear and logically describe the algorithm's workflow.
4. The report includes an analysis of the obtained results.

### Report Format

The report should include a table of flow results between terminals and stores in the following format:

| Terminal   | Store      | Actual Flow (units) |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Terminal 1 | Store 1   | X                    |
| Terminal 1 | Store 2   | Y                    |
| ...        | ...       | ...                  |
| Terminal 2 | Store 14  | Z                    |

The table should present the final flow values between terminals and stores, calculated using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. The data for each terminal and store should reflect the amount of product actually delivered.

After obtaining the table, answer the following questions:

1. Which terminals provide the largest product flow to stores?
2. Which routes have the lowest capacity, and how does this impact overall flow?
3. Which stores received the least products, and can their supply be increased by improving certain route capacities?
4. Are there bottlenecks that can be eliminated to improve the efficiency of the logistics network?

## Task 2: Comparing OOBTree and Dict Efficiency for Range Queries

Develop a program to store a large dataset of product information in two data structuresâ€”OOBTree and dictâ€”and conduct a comparative analysis of their performance for range queries.

### Task Description

1. Use the provided `generated_items_data.csv` file to load product information. Each product includes a unique identifier (ID), name (Name), category (Category), and price (Price).
2. Implement two structures for storing products. The firstâ€”OOBTree from the BTrees library, where the key is the ID, and the value is a dictionary with product attributes. The secondâ€”dict (standard dictionary), where the key is also the ID, and the value is a similar dictionary with product attributes.
3. Create functions for adding products to both structures: `add_item_to_tree` and `add_item_to_dict`.
4. Create functions for performing range queries, finding all products within a specified price range: `range_query_tree` and `range_query_dict`.
5. Measure the total execution time of the range query for each structure using `timeit`.
6. Execute the range query 100 times for each structure to calculate the average execution time.
7. Output the total execution time for each structure, specifically how long it takes to perform 100 queries for OOBTree and dict.

### Technical Requirements

1. Use only OOBTree and the standard dict for comparison.
2. Implement separate functions for adding a product to each structure: `add_item_to_tree`, `add_item_to_dict`.
3. Implement separate functions for range queries: `range_query_tree`, `range_query_dict`.
4. Use the `timeit` library for accurate performance measurement.
5. The time measurement should be conducted for 100 range queries for each structure.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The program correctly executes range queries and returns accurate results for both structures: OOBTree and dict.
2. Data is correctly added to each structure.
3. OOBTree uses the `items(min, max)` method for fast range access.
4. The dict implements range queries using linear search.
5. Comparative execution time results for OOBTree and dict are correctly displayed.
6. OOBTree is expected to show better performance for range queries due to its sorted data structure.
7. The output results should include the total execution time of range queries for each structure in the following format:

```
Total range_query time for OOBTree: X.XXXXXX seconds
Total range_query time for Dict: X.XXXXXX seconds
```

## Logistics Network Analysis

### 1. Which terminals provide the highest flow of goods to stores?

**Terminal 1** supplies goods to the following stores:

- Shop 1: 15 units
- Shop 2: 10 units
- Shop 4: 15 units
- Shop 5: 10 units
- Shop 6: 5 units
- Shop 7: 15 units
- Shop 8: 10 units

**Total flow from Terminal 1: 80 units**

**Terminal 2** supplies goods to the following stores:

- Shop 7: 15 units
- Shop 8: 10 units
- Shop 10: 20 units
- Shop 11: 10 units
- Shop 4: 10 units
- Shop 5: 10 units
- Shop 6: 5 units

**Total flow from Terminal 2: 70 units**

**Conclusion:** Terminal 1 provides the highest flow of goods to stores (80 units).

### 2. Which routes have the lowest capacity, and how does it impact overall flow?

The route **Warehouse 4 -> Shop 13** has the lowest capacity of **5 units**.

**Impact on overall flow:**

- This route acts as a "bottleneck" in the network, restricting the flow of goods to Shop 13.
- As a result, **Shop 13 receives 0 units**, negatively affecting the overall network efficiency.
- The capacity constraint prevents the network from reaching its full potential, as goods cannot reach all stores efficiently.

### 3. Which stores receive the least goods, and can their supply be increased by improving specific routes?

**Stores receiving the least goods:**

- **Shop 3:** 0 units
- **Shop 9:** 0 units
- **Shop 12:** 0 units
- **Shop 13:** 0 units
- **Shop 14:** 0 units

**Ways to increase supply:**

- **Shop 3:** Increase the capacity of the route **Terminal 1 -> Warehouse 1 -> Shop 3**.
- **Shop 9:** Increase the capacity of the routes **Terminal 1 -> Warehouse 3 -> Shop 9** or **Terminal 2 -> Warehouse 3 -> Shop 9**.
- **Shop 12, Shop 13, and Shop 14:** Increase capacity on routes through **Warehouse 4**.

**Conclusion:** Increasing the capacity of these routes will improve supply to stores receiving insufficient goods.

### 4. Are there bottlenecks that can be removed to improve logistics network efficiency?

**Identified bottlenecks:**

- **Warehouse 4 -> Shop 13** (capacity: 5 units)
- Routes leading to stores with 0 supply (**Shop 3, Shop 9, Shop 12, Shop 13, Shop 14**)

**Solutions to remove bottlenecks:**

1. **Increase capacity on weak routes:**
   - For example, increase the capacity of **Warehouse 4 -> Shop 13** from 5 to 10 units.

2. **Add alternative routes:**
   - Introduce new connections from terminals to warehouses or from warehouses to stores to ensure additional supply channels.

3. **Optimize flow distribution:**
   - Redistribute flows between terminals and warehouses to ensure a more balanced supply to all stores.

**Conclusion:** Removing bottlenecks will improve the efficiency of the logistics network and ensure better supply distribution across all stores.
